You can also write in **bold** or _italics_. You can also ~~strike through~~ or write inline `Code Segments`

>Blockquotes are done as such.

Just make sure to separate paragraphs with an emptyline. 
Otherwise, they are considered in the same paragraph.

You link to [Google](https://www.google.com) as such and lists are written has follows:
  1. First you indent with two empty spaces.
  1. Then, you use:
    * `1.` to signal an ordered (i.e. numbered) list, or
    * `*`, `-`, `+` to represent an unordered list.
      1. Make sure to maintain indentation
      1. As it is used to identify sub-lists
  1. Numbering and symboles don't matter as they are auto-generated later.

Tables are pretty easy to make:

| Tables        | Are           | Easy          |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:|
| left-aligned  | centered      | right-aligned |
| header are    | bolded and    | centered      |
| zebra stripes | are neat      | 1             |
